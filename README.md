Project Title:  Pricing for Success

Team Members:  Joe V., Matt A., Jacob S. 

Project Description: 1) Better understand trends and potential correlations in pricing over time.  2) Improve the pricing process 

Project Deliverables:  
1a) Understand  and visual the trends in pricing   and  profit   
1b) Visualize the differences in pricing from region to region and over time 
1c) Join pricing dataset with external data to analyzed correlations, eg GDP and raw materials

2a) Optimize Pricing Process 
2b) Use exising pricing dataset xcel 
2c) build user interface allow it to be continuously modified by about 20 users 
2d) 1 pricing data string for each month 



Datasets to be used: 
1) CSV or xcel or numbers documents about 400 lines and 10 rows  
2) map visualaztion (is this a data set) 
3) GDP by country data 
4) raw material data, natural gas



Tasks  
1) Create data set manually 
2) Find websites with GDP and natural gas data  
3) create interface for each user to modify their customer data each month 4) create code that creates not data string within the data set for pricing for each month 
5) Create code that parses the dataset by customer to create a customer specific price list in a nice format 
6) create a different data set that combines the pricing dataset with other data to do corrleation and visualization  
7) create code to do correlation of prices and changes in prices to raw material and GDP data 
8) create visualation of out put of number 7 and visualization of the regional pricing using mapbox
